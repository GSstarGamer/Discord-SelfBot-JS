# Discord Self-Bot with NodeJS

Made with `discord.js-selfbot-v13`

## Configuration
Start by opening `example.env`. It should look like this.

```env
TOKEN=TOKENHERE
```

Now replace `TOKENHERE` with your discord token (account token). Then save the file.
And then rename the file to `.env`

Then open the `config.json` file. Should look like this.

```json
{
    "SelfBot Name": "SelfBot",
    "Prefix": ";"
}
```

You can replace `SelfBot` with any name you like.
&
You can replace `;` to any prefix you like.

Pretty self explanatory.
